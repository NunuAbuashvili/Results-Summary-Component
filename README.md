## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did not learn anything new while working through this project, but it was a good challenge for practising CSS flexbox knowledge.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on flexbox and grid in future projects.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Bitcamp 101 (Georgia) for amazing lectures, and also, my mentor Paata Gharibashvili who has helped me a lot while working on different projects.
